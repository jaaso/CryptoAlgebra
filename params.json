As far as math goes, I have been getting into abstract algebra, and am taking my second course this semester.  Additionally, I am in a cryptography class, which as it turns out, is a great application for ring theory.\r\n\r\nI plan on talking about the crypto-algorithms I learn in class, and some of the theory behind them.\r\n\r\nCode examples will be in Haskell, since the math-y foundations of Haskell play very nicely with algebra, and more importantly, why not.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
